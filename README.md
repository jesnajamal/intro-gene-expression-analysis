# Introductory Gene Expression Analysis

This repository contains introductory exploratory work on gene expression data,
created as part of my transition into computational biology and bioinformatics.

## Purpose
- Learn the basic structure of gene expression datasets
- Practice data handling using Python and Pandas
- Perform simple exploratory analysis and visualization

## Status
This work reflects an early learning phase and focuses on building
fundamental understanding rather than advanced biological interpretation.
